# Calculator
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

### Functionality

This is the [Calculator](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator) project, where I make a working calculator in the browser with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Thoughts

This was my first complex project utilizing Javascript. I'm writing this much later, reflecting back on when I wrote it, and I realize that it was so early on that I hadn't yet learned the principles of organizing and refactoring code. As a result, this was likely much messier than it needed to be, and was more of a headache to create than it needed to be.

Nonetheless, it was a great exercise in Javascript, and allowed me to really get my hands dirty before moving on to Ruby.

God bless.
